The CareerDevs Java curriculum is constantly evolving.<br>
<br>
In order to better transition from Javascript to Java curriculum, the students will start out with two to two and a half weeks of algorithms.
They'll start by writing them in Javascript, their most familiar language, to master their algorithmic thinking, and then slowly begin to convert them over to Java once they feel more comfortable with the mindset solving algorithms entails. 
These algorithms are not included in this repository.

<br>
Once students have a grasp on the language syntax of Java, we'll begin to move them over to developing basic classes, here shown in the "Basic Classes" package.
These classes will work to demonstrate very basic OOP principles, and help us create our first instances of a class.
